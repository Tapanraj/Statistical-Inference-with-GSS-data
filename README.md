# Statistical-Inference-with-GSS-data

The General Social Survey gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes. Altogether the GSS is the single best source for sociological and attitudinal trend data covering the United States. It allows researchers to examine the structure and functioning of society in general as well as the role played by relevant subgroups and to compare the United States to other nations.

The National Data Program for the Social Sciences has been conducted since 1972 by NORC at the University of Chicago, with the support of the National Science Foundation. This program has had two main goals:

To conduct basic scientific research on the structure and development of American society.
To distribute up-to-date, important, high-quality data to social scientists, students, policy makers, and others.
This research is carried out by a data collection program designed to both monitor social change within the United States and to compare the United States to other nations. Data on social change in the United States is collected as part of the GSS.
